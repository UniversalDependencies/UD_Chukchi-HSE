# Summary

This data is a manual annotation of the corpus from multimedia annotated corpus
of the [Chuklang](http://chuklang.ru/) project, a dialectal corpus of the Amguema
variant of Chukchi.

# Introduction

The corpus contains spoken Chukchi in the Amguema variant. Chukchi is a polysynthetic
language spoken in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the north-east of Siberia.


# Acknowledgements

This work is entirely based on the glossed corpus developed by 
the [Chuklang](http://chuklang.ru/) project. They have their own
[acknowledgements](http://chuklang.ru/acknowledgements) here.

# Orthography

The original texts were transcribed from recordings using a Latin-based transcription 
system and glosses. The system of glosses is largely described in the document 
[Глоссы Экспедицинного Проекта Чукотка—2016](http://chuklang.ru/static/chukchi_glosses_20171020.pdf).

The transcriptions have been converted to Chukchi orthography automatically using
a [convertor](https://github.com/BasilisAndr/chkchn/tree/master/translit) developed
by [Vasilisa Adriyanets](github.com/BasilisAndr/). There may be errors in the automatic
conversion. Particularly the treatment of Russian loan words and proper nouns, the 
character *s*, and the glottal stop.
